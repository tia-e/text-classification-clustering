# Classification-Clustering Homework

This is the homework code for Education First using Python. For this exercise, it is asked to 
build a system to classify the Level of writing samples by English
language learners, using a data set gathered from users.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:
-python3.4 or higher
-pip
-nltk
---->nltk.download('punkt')
---->nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
-pandas
-scikit-learn
-lxml


### Installing - Make it work

Please put your data file under text-classification-clustering/data/

For classification go to text-classification-clustering/classification/main.py
-------------------------------------------------------
In the main() function, you can choose which experiment to run.

Validation Experiment
- crossValidationExperimentWithXML() 
        Use this for cross-validation experiment given an xmlFile.
- crossValidationExperimentWithXML() 
        Use this for cross-validation experiment if you have already create the .pk file.
   
Test Experiment
- experimentWithXML() for train-test experiment 
    Use this for cross-validation experiment given an xmlFile.
- experimentWithDF() for train-test experiment 
    Use this for cross-validation experiment if you have already have a dataframe stored on a .pk file


The different parameters (common to all the experiments  functions)
- classLabel : 'the class on which you want to perform the experiment.
        Possible values : level_id', 'group_id' 
- classifierName : The name of different classes
    Possible values : 'NB'/'LR'/'DTree'/'KNN'/'SVM'
- featureVecName = 'tfidfVect'/'countVect'/'tfidfNgramVect'/'customedFeaturesVect'
- isSample = 
    Possible values : True/False
- sampleSize : the percentage of data to keep in the sample
    Value : 0.1 for 10%
-xmlFileName =  relative path to location of your xmlFile
    Given the organization of the projection used "../data/xmlfile.xml"
-dfFileName : relative path to location of the stored dataframe
    Given the organization of the projection used "../data/dataframefile.pk"
- cvType : 2 types, Cross validation can be performed to choose the right classifier or the right feature
    Possibile value : 'on-classifier' 'on-feature' 
- cvFold = Number of fold for cross-validation


For clustering go to text-classification-clustering/clustering/main.py
-------------------------------------------------

You can run a Kmeans onf your data.
Specify the relative path to the location of '.pk' file where is stored your data and give the number of cluster you want to have.
